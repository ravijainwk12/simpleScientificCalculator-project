# simpleScientificCalculator-project

This project implements a feature-rich scientific calculator with a user-friendly interface. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), and additional scientific functionalities such as factorial computation.

Key Features:

Basic Arithmetic Operations:

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations are supported.
Users can input mathematical expressions and get instant calculations.

Trigonometric Functions:

Sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) functions are available.
Users can perform trigonometric calculations using both degrees and radians.

Error Handling:

The calculator incorporates error handling to manage exceptions during calculations.
If an error occurs, the display will show an "Error" message.

Additional Functions:

Factorial: The calculator can compute the factorial of a given number.
Backspace: Users can delete the last entered character.

User Interface:

The calculator's display is represented by the 'display' element.
Clear Display: Users can clear the display to start a new calculation.

Usage:

Enter mathematical expressions directly or use the provided buttons.
Trigonometric functions operate on the result of the current expression in the display.
Factorial function calculates the factorial of a given number.
